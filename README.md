# CLI-password-Manager
Develop a secure command-line password manager that stores and retrieves  credentials using AES-256 encryption. The application will feature a master password  system, JSON-based storage, and CRUD operations for managing credentials (websites,  usernames, passwords). All sensitive data remains encrypted at rest.
